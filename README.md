# Safe SDK Multi-Signature Wallet Implementation for Goerli Testnet
[Implementation Address https://multisig-helper.dev.lat/](https://multisig-helper.dev.lat/)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of the Safe SDK for the creation and management of multi-signature wallets, specifically for the Goerli Testnet environment. It is designed to utilize the Safe SDK's capabilities for enhanced security and efficient digital asset management.

## Implementation Details

The implementation is based on the `group-wallet-start` branch of the Safe-global initiative. Additionally, it follows the methodologies and instructions presented in the following YouTube video tutorial:

For a practical guide and visual walkthrough, please refer to the video linked above.

The codebase integrates the principles and steps outlined in the video to facilitate the creation of multi-signature wallets on the Ethereum Goerli Testnet.

## Features

- **Multi-Signature Wallet Creation**: Users can create multi-signature wallets on the Goerli Testnet, which require multiple signatures to authorize transactions, enhancing security.
- **Transaction Management**: The platform allows for proposing, signing, and executing transactions in a multi-signature fashion.
- **SDK Integration**: The Safe SDK is integrated into the project, enabling direct interaction with Ethereum wallets and contracts on the Goerli Testnet.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Safe SDK implementation:

1. Clone the repositor.
2. Install the necessary dependencies as listed in the project's documentation.
3. Refer to the setup instructions to configure the SDK for use with the Goerli Testnet.
4. Follow the tutorial video for a step-by-step guide on creating and managing multi-signature wallets.
